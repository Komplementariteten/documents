# Go, Introduction to an specialized Language

[@Komplementariteten/documents](https://github.com/Komplementariteten/documents/tree/master/go)

# Agenda

1.  Why Go?
2.  Overview
3.  Syntax
4.  OOP
5.  Tooling
6.  Concurrency
7.  Std. packages

# Why Go? I

- multicore processors, networked systems, massive computation clusters, and the web programming model were being worked around rather than addressed head-on.

- server programs comprise tens of millions of lines of code, are worked on by hundreds or even thousands of programmers, and are updated literally every day.

- build times, even on large compilation clusters, have stretched to many minutes, even hours.

---

# Why Go? II
Consequences

- Go was therefore designed with clarity and tooling in mind, and has a clean syntax. (only 25 keywords)

- Go can be parsed without type information or a symbol table; there is no type-specific context.

- Go does have to address the issues that make large-scale software development difficult.

---

# Overview I

- Go has a roughly C like systax

---

# Overview II

- Explicit error handling

<iframe class="goplayground" src="https://play.golang.org/p/-zWNSkHmvPa"></iframe>

---

# Overview III

- Buildin concurrency

<iframe class="goplayground" src="https://play.golang.org/p/n8xaGOYM4X2"></iframe>

---

# Overview IV

- Garbage collection
```go
    type X struct {
        a, b, c int
        buf [256]byte
    }
```

- Packages
```go
    import "encoding/json"
    var dec = json.NewDecoder(reader)
```

---

# Syntax I

- declarations are closer to Pascal than to C

- knows only call by name

- names are package local by default, but can be exported

---

# Syntax II

- no pointer arithmetic

- no implicit number conversions

- no type aliases

- interface types

- reflection

---

# OOP I

- methods can be of any type (not just classes)

- no type-based inheritance

- interfaces encourage composition over inheritance
Example:
```go
    type Writer interface {
        Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    }
```
---

# OOP II

<iframe class="goplayground" src="https://play.golang.org/p/qZyB41gno-Z"></iframe>

---

# OOP III

<iframe class="goplayground" src="https://play.golang.org/p/MeA6hRVdZ7_k"></iframe>

---

# Tooling I

designed to make tooling easy

- **gofmt**

- **gofix**

- **gotest**

- **godoc**

- **delve**

---

# Tooling II - Testing

Testing
```go
func TestCreateSortedHist(t *testing.T) {
    sl := SetupTestDataSh(t)
    fs := sl.Freqs()
    if fs[sl.size-2] >= fs[sl.size-1] {
        t.Fatal("Failed to sort List")
    }
}
```

---

# Tooling III - Benchmarking

Benchmarking
```go
func BenchmarkConnect(b *testing.B) {
    cfg := GetTestCfg()
    d, err := OpenStorage(cfg)
    if err != nil {
        b.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer d.Close()
    d.Serve()
    con := d.Connect()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        r := new(StorageRequest)
        con.RequestChannel <- *r
        <-con.ResponseChannel
    }
    CleanTestDb()
}
```

---

# Concurrency I

Go embodies a variant of CSP with first-class channels.

<iframe class="goplayground" style="height:75%" src="https://play.golang.org/p/DXJEu6oBy20"></iframe>

---

# Concurrency II - CSP

- Expressive concurrency based on message-passing

- Sequential processing

- Synchronous communication through channels

- Multiplexing of channels with alternation

---

# Concurrency III - CSP

![CSP vs. Actor](CSP vs. Actor.png)

--- 

# Std. Packages I

- Go has an rich std. package set

- and an even more rich community set of packages
