# Why Go?

- multicore processors, networked systems, massive computation clusters, and the web programming model were being worked around rather than addressed head-on.
- server programs comprise tens of millions of lines of code, are worked on by hundreds or even thousands of programmers, and are updated literally every day.
- build times, even on large compilation clusters, have stretched to many minutes, even hours.
